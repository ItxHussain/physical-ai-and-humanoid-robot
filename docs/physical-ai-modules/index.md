# Physical AI Modules Book

## Overview

This book provides a comprehensive exploration of the four core Physical AI modules that enable humanoid robots to achieve perception → planning → navigation → manipulation:

1. **ROS 2 (Robotic Nervous System)** - Middleware for robot control
2. **Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Physics and sensor simulation
3. **NVIDIA Isaac (AI-Robot Brain)** - AI-powered robot intelligence
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Cognitive planning and reasoning

Each module builds upon the others to create a complete humanoid robot system capable of complex autonomous behaviors.

## Learning Objectives

After reading this book, you will be able to:
- Understand how the four Physical AI modules work together
- Explain the role of each module in humanoid robot functionality
- Identify practical applications of these technologies
- Apply these concepts to your own robotics projects
