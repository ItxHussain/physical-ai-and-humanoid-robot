# Physical AI Modules Book

This project contains a comprehensive book on Physical AI modules, covering ROS 2, Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity), NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems. The book explains how humanoid robots achieve perception → planning → navigation → manipulation.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the Docusaurus development server and open the book in your browser.

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a static site in the `build` directory that can be deployed to GitHub Pages or any other static hosting service.
